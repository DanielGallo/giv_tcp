# GivTCP Settings & Control Guide

## GivTCP Control (Inverters)
GivTCP provides a wide range of inverter control settings. When using HA an MQTT device is automatically created for each inverter:

## GivTCP Control (EVC)

Coming soon

## GivTCP MQTT Control (Inverters)
By enabling MQTT in the config, GivTCP will publish directly to the nominated MQTT broker all inverter data. Data is published to "GivEnergy/<serial_number>/" by default or you can nominate a specific root topic by setting "MQTT_TOPIC" in the settings.

Control is also available using MQTT. By publishing data to the same MQTT broker as above you can trigger the control methods as per the above table.

Root topic for control is:

"GivEnergy/control/<serial_number>/" - Default (note lower case "control")

"<MQTT_TOPIC>/control/<serial_number>/" - If MQTT_TOPIC is set
